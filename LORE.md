## DEAR PEOPLE FROM THE FUTURE:

Here's what we figured out so far (MARCH 3RD, 2025):

# 0.  Introduction & Explanation

## !!!***READ THIS FIRST***!!!

## ALL OF THE STUFF BELOW IS <u>NOT DIRECTLY CONFIRMED (UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED) BY ANY OF THE TETR.IO TEAM MEMBERS (**INCLUDING GARBO**) -fily :droidangel:</u>

This document serves as a "starting point" for people who just find out about the lore, and people who need an overview. You will see some markings throughout the document.

(?) - Requires additional information/citation,

(!!) - Something of a significant importance,

// TODO: optimize this :tf:

# 1. What We Know So Far

Garbo ([Link](https://tetra.channel/u/garbo)) is the lore-master, and handles everything lore-related.

(!!) **There are 2 confirmed characters in the "TETR.IO Cinematic Universe" (Trademark pending!), "[[Snowcrates]]" and "[[Mathis]]" (press on the names to go to their respective files!! (unless you printed this document out, why?)). Right now (March 3rd, 2025), we do not know anything more than a few lines and hints from garbo about these characters, but we *****do***** know that they play a significant role in the universe.**

(!!) **"**[**The Wheel of Fortune**]()**" plays a **<u>**very**</u>** significant role in the "past"(???), most likely before the Zenith Tower was even built.**

# 2. (TODO: finish this lol)
