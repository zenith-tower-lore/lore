# 1. What We Know So Far
- Garbo ([Link](https://tetra.channel/u/garbo)) is the lore-master, and handles everything lore-related.
- (!!) __There are 2 confirmed characters in the "TETR.IO Cinematic Universe" (Trademark pending!), "[[Snowcrates]]" and "[[Mathis]]" (press on the names to go to their respective files!! (unless you printed this document out, why?)). Right now (March 3rd, 2025), we do not know anything more than a few lines and hints from garbo about these characters, but we *do* know that they play a significant role in the universe.
- (!!) __"[The Wheel of Fortune](TWoF)" plays a <u><b>very</b></u> significant role in the "past"(???), most likely before the Zenith Tower was even built.__

# 2. (TODO: finish this lol)
